# kmeans

There is one paper related to this project. 

It is A hybrid clustering method with a filter feature selection for hyperspectral image classification

The code includes two parts. 
The existed algorithm is a demo to get familiar with the kmeans algorithm.
The new algorithm uses two different kernels, such as Euclidean distance and spectral information divergence.
The new algorithm can put self-adaptive weights from the different images for the two kernels.
